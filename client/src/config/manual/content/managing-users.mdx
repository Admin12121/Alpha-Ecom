# Managing Users

The **Users** page gives you a complete view of everyone who has registered on your platform. From here you can search for users, filter by status, change roles, and manage individual accounts.

## Accessing the Users Page

1. Click **Users** in the left sidebar
2. The page loads with a table listing every registered user

---

## Understanding the Users Table

The table displays the following columns:

| Column | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| **User** | The user's display name and email address |
| **Role** | Either **Admin** (full access to admin panel) or **User** (regular customer) |
| **Social** | How the user registered — **default** means email/password signup, **google** means Google OAuth login |
| **State** | The current account state — **Active**, **Inactive**, or **Suspended** |
| **Actions** | A three-dot menu (**⋯**) with additional options for each user |

---

## Searching for Users

At the top of the page, you will find a **search bar**. You can search by:

- User's display name
- Email address

Type your search term and press **Enter** or click the arrow button. The table will filter to show only matching results.

> **Tip:** Searching is case-insensitive, so typing "test" will match "Test", "TEST", and "test".

---

## Filtering by Status

Next to the search bar, click the **Status** dropdown to filter users by their account state:

- **All** — Show every user regardless of status
- **Active** — Show only active accounts
- **Inactive** — Show only inactive accounts
- **Suspended** — Show only suspended accounts

This is useful when you need to quickly find users who have been suspended or deactivated.

---

## Customizing Visible Columns

Click the **Columns** dropdown (next to the Status filter) to toggle which columns are visible in the table. This lets you simplify the view if you only need certain information.

---

## Adding a New User

1. Click the **New User** button in the top-right corner (it has a plus icon)
2. Fill in the required details:
   - **Display name** — The name that appears in the system
   - **Email address** — Must be unique
   - **Password** — Set a temporary password for the user
   - **Role** — Choose **Admin** or **User**
3. Click **Create** to save the new user

> **Important:** Only create Admin accounts for people who need full access to the admin panel. Regular customers should always have the **User** role.

---

## Managing Individual Users

Click the three-dot menu (**⋯**) on any user row to see available actions:

- **View Profile** — See the full user profile and order history
- **Change Role** — Switch between Admin and User roles
- **Suspend Account** — Temporarily disable the user's access
- **Activate Account** — Re-enable a suspended account
- **Delete Account** — Permanently remove the user (this cannot be undone)

> **Warning:** Deleting a user is permanent. All their data, including order history and wishlist, will be removed. Consider suspending the account instead if you might need to restore it later.

---

## Pagination

At the bottom of the table, you will see pagination controls:

- **Previous** / **Next** buttons to navigate between pages
- A page number indicator showing which page you are on
- **Rows per page** dropdown (defaults to 10) — you can change this to show more or fewer users per page

On the right side, you will also see a count like **"0 of 2 selected"** which shows how many user rows you have selected for bulk actions.

---

## Understanding User Roles

| Role | Access Level |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full access to the entire admin panel — can manage products, orders, users, settings, and everything else covered in this manual |
| **User** | Customer-level access only — can browse products, place orders, book appointments, write reviews, and manage their own account |

---

## Tips for User Management

> **Tip:** Regularly review the Users page to check for suspicious accounts, especially those created via default (email/password) signup.

> **Tip:** If a customer contacts you about account issues, use the search bar to quickly find their account by email.

> **Tip:** Keep the number of Admin accounts to a minimum. Each admin has full control over the store, so only grant this role to trusted team members.
