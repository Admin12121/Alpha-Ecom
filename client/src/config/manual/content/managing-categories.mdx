# Managing Categories

Categories are the **backbone of your product organization**. They determine how products are grouped, how customers browse your store, and how filters work on your storefront. Every product must belong to a category, so setting up your categories properly is one of the first things you should do when configuring your store.

---

## What Are Categories?

A category is a label that groups similar products together. For example:

| Category | Products It Would Contain |
|---|---|
| **Long Sleeve** | Long sleeve shirts, dress shirts, formal shirts |
| **Luxury Coat** | Premium coats, overcoats, trench coats |
| **Casual Wear** | T-shirts, polo shirts, casual jackets |
| **Formal Suits** | Two-piece suits, three-piece suits, tuxedos |
| **Accessories** | Ties, cufflinks, belts, pocket squares |

Categories serve multiple purposes:

- **Organization** — Products are grouped logically so customers can browse by type
- **Filtering** — Customers can filter products by category on the shop page
- **Analytics** — The dashboard shows revenue performance broken down by category
- **Navigation** — Categories can appear in your site's navigation menu

## Accessing the Category Page

1. Click **Products** in the left sidebar to expand the submenu
2. Click **category**
3. The Category management page loads

## Understanding the Category Page Layout

The Category page has two main areas:

### 1. Add Category Form (Top Section)

This collapsible section contains:
- **Category Name** input field — where you type the name of a new category
- **Add Category** button — click to create the category

The section can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the accordion arrow on the right side.

### 2. Existing Categories List (Below)

Below the form, you will see a list of all categories you have already created. Each category is displayed as a collapsible row with the category name. Click the arrow on the right side of any category to expand it and see additional options.

## Creating a New Category

### From the Category Page

1. Navigate to **Products → category** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Add Category** accordion header to expand the form (if it is not already expanded)
3. In the **Category Name** field, type the name of your new category
   - Example: `Winter Collection`, `Formal Shirts`, `Premium Coats`
4. Click the **Add Category** button (black button)
5. The new category will be created and appear in the list below

> **Tip:** Category names should be clear and descriptive. Use names that your customers would naturally search for or expect to see when browsing. Avoid internal jargon or abbreviations.

### From the Add Product Page (Inline)

You can also create categories directly while adding a product, without leaving the page:

1. While on the **Add Product** page, look at the **Category** section on the right side
2. Click the **Add** button next to the category dropdown
3. A dialog box will appear with a text field
4. Type the name of your new category
5. Click **Add Category**
6. The category is created and automatically selected for the current product

<ManualImage src="/docs/create_category.jpeg" alt="Add Category dialog from Add Product page" caption="The inline Add Category dialog — type the category name and click Add Category to create it without leaving the Add Product page" />

> **Tip:** The inline method is convenient when you realize you need a new category while you are in the middle of adding a product. You do not need to navigate away, create the category separately, and come back.

## Managing Existing Categories

### Viewing Categories

All your existing categories are listed below the Add Category form. Each category appears as a row with:
- The **category name** displayed on the left
- A **collapse/expand arrow** on the right

### Expanding a Category

Click on any category row or its arrow to expand it. When expanded, you can see:
- Additional details about the category
- Options to edit or delete the category
- The number of products assigned to this category

### Editing a Category Name

1. Expand the category by clicking on it
2. Modify the category name in the edit field
3. Save your changes

> **Important:** Renaming a category affects **all products** currently assigned to it. The products will automatically reflect the new category name. No products will be lost or unassigned.

### Deleting a Category

1. Expand the category by clicking on it
2. Click the **delete** option
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

> **Warning:** Before deleting a category, make sure no products are currently assigned to it, or reassign those products to a different category first. Deleting a category that has products assigned to it may cause those products to appear without a category on your storefront.

## Best Practices for Category Organization

### Keep It Simple

Do not create too many categories. A store with 50 categories is harder to navigate than one with 8-12 well-organized categories. Think about what makes sense for your customers, not your internal inventory system.

**Good Example (Simple and Clear):**
- Formal Suits
- Casual Wear
- Coats & Jackets
- Shirts
- Pants & Trousers
- Accessories

**Bad Example (Too Many, Too Specific):**
- Blue Suits
- Black Suits
- Grey Suits
- Navy Suits
- Summer Shirts
- Winter Shirts
- Spring Shirts
- Short Sleeve Shirts
- Long Sleeve Shirts

In the bad example, colors and seasons should be handled by **product variants** and **filters**, not separate categories.

### Use Consistent Naming

| Inconsistent (Bad) | Consistent (Good) |
|---|---|
| Coat, Coats, The Coats, COATS | Coats & Jackets |
| shirt, Formal Shirt, shirts | Formal Shirts |
| pant, Pants, TROUSERS | Pants & Trousers |

Pick a naming convention and stick with it across all categories. Use **Title Case** (capitalize the first letter of each word) for a professional appearance.

### Think Like a Customer

When deciding on categories, ask yourself:
- "If I were shopping on this site, what categories would I expect to see?"
- "Would I know where to find a wool overcoat? A slim-fit dress shirt?"
- "Are these categories intuitive enough that a first-time visitor would understand them?"

### Plan Before Creating

Before creating categories, write down all the product types you plan to sell and group them logically:

1. **List all product types** — coats, suits, shirts, pants, ties, belts, etc.
2. **Group similar items** — coats and jackets together, ties and cufflinks together
3. **Create 6-12 categories** that cover all your groups
4. **Name them clearly** — use customer-friendly names, not internal codes

---

## How Categories Appear to Customers

Categories are used throughout your storefront:

1. **Product Detail Page** — The category name appears below the product title, telling customers what type of product they are viewing
2. **Shop/Collection Page** — Customers can filter products by category to narrow down their browsing
3. **Filter Sidebar** — If you have set up category filters in Settings → Filters, customers can check/uncheck categories to filter the product listing
4. **Dashboard Analytics** — The admin dashboard's Analytics tab shows revenue performance per category

---

## Categories vs. Filters vs. Variants

It is important to understand the difference between these three concepts:

| Feature | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Category** | Broad product grouping | "Coats & Jackets", "Formal Suits" |
| **Filters** | Narrowing down products within or across categories | Filter by "Casual" or "Formal" style, or by color |
| **Variants** | Different versions of the same product | Size XL in Navy, Size M in Black |

**Categories** answer: "What type of product is this?"
**Filters** answer: "Help me narrow down the products I am browsing."
**Variants** answer: "Which specific version of this product do I want?"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Category Does Not Appear in Dropdown

If you just created a category but it does not appear in the category dropdown on the Add Product page:
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure the category was actually saved (check the Category page list)

### Cannot Delete a Category

If you are unable to delete a category, it may have products assigned to it. First reassign those products to a different category, then try deleting again.

### Duplicate Category Names

Avoid creating categories with the same or very similar names. This confuses both customers and your own product organization. Before creating a new category, check the existing list to make sure it does not already exist.

## Tips

> **Tip:** Start with 5-8 categories that cover your main product types. You can always add more later as your product catalog grows.

> **Tip:** Review your categories periodically. If a category only has 1-2 products, consider merging it into a broader category. If a category has 50+ products, consider splitting it into subcategories.

> **Tip:** The order of categories in the list matters for customer navigation. Put your most popular or important categories at the top.

> **Tip:** When naming categories, avoid using size-related or color-related names (like "Blue Suits" or "XL Shirts"). These attributes should be handled by product variants and filters, not categories.
