# Uploading Product Images

Product images are the **first thing customers notice** when browsing your store. High-quality, well-organized images can dramatically increase your sales. This guide covers everything you need to know about uploading, managing, and tagging product images in the admin panel.

## Why Product Images Matter

Online shoppers cannot physically see or touch your products. Your images are their **only visual reference**. Studies show that:

- Products with **multiple images** sell significantly more than those with just one
- Images showing the product from **different angles** reduce return rates
- **Color-accurate** images build trust and reduce customer complaints

Always treat your product images as one of the most important parts of your listing.

## Where to Upload Images

When you are on the **Add Product** or **Edit Product** page, the **Images** section is located on the **right side** of the form.

<ManualImage src="/docs/add_product.jpeg" alt="Add Product page with Images section" caption="The Images section on the right side of the Add Product page — click the large area or the smaller slots to upload your product photos" />

The Images section has two areas:

1. **Main Image Area** — The large rectangular area at the top that says **"Click or Drop here"**. This is where your primary product image will be displayed.

2. **Additional Image Slots** — Below the main area, you will see **smaller slots** marked with `+` icons. These are for additional product photos (different angles, close-ups, styling shots, etc.).

## How to Upload Images

There are two methods to upload images:

### Method 1: Click to Upload

1. **Click** anywhere inside the main image area (the area that says "Click or Drop here") or on any of the `+` slots below it
2. Your computer's **file browser** will open
3. Navigate to the folder where your product photos are saved
4. **Select one or more image files** (you can hold `Ctrl` to select multiple files)
5. Click **Open**
6. The images will be uploaded and displayed in the image slots

### Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. Open the folder containing your product photos on your computer
2. **Select the image files** you want to upload
3. **Drag them** from your computer's file browser and **drop them** directly onto the image area in the admin panel
4. The images will be uploaded automatically

> **Tip:** Drag and drop is faster when you have multiple images to upload at once. Just select them all and drop them in one go.

## Image Slots Explained

| Slot | Purpose | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Main slot** (large area) | The primary product image — this is the first image customers see in product listings and on the product detail page | Use your best, most representative photo — front view, well-lit, clean background |
| **Slot 2** | Additional angle or view | Show the back of the product or a different angle |
| **Slot 3** | Detail or close-up shot | Show fabric texture, buttons, stitching, or other fine details |
| **Slot 4** | Lifestyle or styling shot | Show the product being worn or styled in context |
| **Slot 5** | Alternative view | Show the product folded, packaged, or from another perspective |

You can upload up to **5 images** per product. While you do not need to fill every slot, more images always help customers make better purchasing decisions.

## Managing Uploaded Images

### Removing a Single Image

1. **Hover** your mouse over any uploaded image
2. A **red delete button** (trash icon) will appear in the top-right corner of that image
3. **Click** the delete button to remove that specific image

### Removing All Images

1. When images are uploaded, a **"Remove All"** link appears in the top-right corner of the Images section header
2. Click **Remove All** to clear every uploaded image at once

> **Warning:** Removing images is immediate. There is no undo. Make sure you have the original files saved on your computer before deleting images from a product.

## Tagging Images by Color (Multi-Variant Products)

When you create a **Multi Variant** product with multiple colors, you can **tag each image with a specific color**. This is a powerful feature that ensures customers see the correct product images when they select a color on the product page.

### How Color Tagging Works

1. First, set up your product variants with different colors (see **Product Variants** section)
2. In the Images section, each uploaded image will show a **color indicator** — small colored circles that let you assign the image to a specific color variant
3. Click on the color circle to **tag** that image with the corresponding color
4. When a customer selects "Navy" on the product page, they will only see images tagged with the Navy color

<ManualImage src="/docs/multi_varient_product.jpeg" alt="Multi-variant product with color-tagged images" caption="A multi-variant product showing color-tagged images — notice the colored circles (Navy, Black, White) on each image thumbnail indicating which color variant the image belongs to" />

### Why Color Tagging Is Important

Without color tagging:
- A customer selects "White" but sees images of the Navy version → confusion
- All images are shown regardless of selected color → messy, unprofessional

With color tagging:
- Customer selects "Navy" → only sees Navy product images → clear and professional
- Customer switches to "White" → images update to show the White version → great experience

> **Important:** If you have a multi-variant product with different colors, **always tag your images with the correct color**. Upload separate photos for each color and tag them accordingly. This is one of the biggest quality improvements you can make for your product listings.

## Image Guidelines and Best Practices

### Recommended Image Specifications

| Specification | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **File format** | JPEG or PNG (JPEG recommended for photos, PNG for graphics) |
| **Minimum resolution** | 800 × 1000 pixels |
| **Recommended resolution** | 1200 × 1500 pixels or higher |
| **Aspect ratio** | Portrait orientation (taller than wide) works best for clothing |
| **File size** | Keep under 5MB per image — the system will optimize them, but smaller files upload faster |
| **Background** | Clean, neutral background (white, light grey, or studio backdrop) |

### Photography Tips

> **Tip:** Use **natural light** or studio lighting. Avoid harsh shadows and direct flash. Even lighting makes colors appear accurate and details visible.

> **Tip:** Shoot from **multiple angles** — front, back, side, and a close-up detail shot. The more angles you provide, the more confident customers feel about purchasing.

> **Tip:** If possible, show the product **on a model or mannequin**. This helps customers visualize how the product looks when worn. A coat on a hanger looks very different from a coat on a person.

> **Tip:** Make sure the **colors in your photos match the actual product**. Color accuracy is one of the top reasons for product returns. Use proper white balance settings on your camera.

> **Tip:** Keep your photography style **consistent** across all products. Use the same background, lighting, and angle patterns. This creates a cohesive, professional look for your entire store.

### What NOT to Do

| Bad Practice | Why It's a Problem |
|---|---|
| Blurry or low-resolution images | Looks unprofessional, customers cannot see product details |
| Cluttered or distracting backgrounds | Draws attention away from the product |
| Only uploading one image | Customers want to see different angles before buying |
| Using stock photos instead of real product photos | Misleads customers and leads to returns and negative reviews |
| Inconsistent image sizes or orientations | Makes product listings look messy and unorganized |
| Images with text overlays or watermarks | Looks unprofessional and distracting |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Click or Drop here" Does Not Open File Browser

This usually happens when you accidentally click outside the upload area. Make sure you click **directly on** the "Click or Drop here" text or within the bordered image area.

### Image Does Not Appear After Upload

- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the file is a valid image format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Try refreshing the page and uploading again
- If the file is very large (over 10MB), try compressing it first using an online image compressor

### Image Looks Stretched or Distorted

This happens when the image has an unusual aspect ratio. The system displays images in a standard portrait orientation. For best results, crop your images to a **portrait aspect ratio** (e.g., 4:5 or 2:3) before uploading.

### Color Tag Not Appearing on Images

Color tags only appear when you have set up **Multi Variant** product type with at least one color variant defined. Make sure you:

1. Select **Multi Variant** as the product type
2. Add at least one variant with a color specified
3. The color tag circles will then appear on your uploaded images
