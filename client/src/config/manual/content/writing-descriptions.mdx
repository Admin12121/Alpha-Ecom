# Writing Product Descriptions

A good product description helps customers understand what they are buying. Since they cannot touch or try on your products in person, your words need to do the job for them.

Your description should answer these simple questions:

- **What is this product?** — What type of clothing is it?
- **Who is it for?** — Men, women, or unisex? Formal or casual?
- **What makes it special?** — What materials, features, or design details stand out?
- **How should I take care of it?** — How to wash, dry, and store it?

## Where to Write the Description

When you are adding or editing a product, you will see a large text box called **Product Description**. This is where you type everything about the product.

## How to Format Your Description

You do not need any special skills to format your description. Just use a few simple tricks with your keyboard:

### Creating Sections

To create a **section heading** (like "Design Details" or "Care Instructions"), type two hash marks `##` followed by a space, then the section name:

```
## Design Details
## Care Instructions
## Size & Fit
```

**Why this matters:** Each section heading you create becomes a **collapsible section** on the product page. Customers can click on the section name to open it and read the details inside. This keeps the page clean and organized.

### Creating Bullet Point Lists

To create a **list of points**, start each line with a dash `-` followed by a space:

```
- Collar    : Classic lapel
- Closure   : Button front
- Pockets   : Two side pockets
- Style     : Minimal, modern luxury
```

This is the best way to list features, materials, and details because it is easy for customers to scan quickly.

### Making Text Bold

To make a word or phrase **stand out in bold**, put two stars `**` before and after it:

```
**Premium wool blend** for superior warmth
```

This shows up as: **Premium wool blend** for superior warmth

### Adding Quick Tags

You can add **tags** at the very beginning of your description to help with organization. Just type a hash `#` followed by a word (no space between them):

```
#white #small #formal #winter
```

Put these on the very first line of your description, before anything else.

## What Sections Should I Include?

Here is a simple template you can follow for every product. You do not have to include every section — just the ones that apply to your product.

### 1. Main Description

Write 1-2 sentences about what the product is. Keep it simple and clear:

```
## description : Classic navy wool coat designed for everyday wear and cooler weather. Made with durable materials and a clean silhouette, suitable for casual, office, and semi-formal use.
```

### 2. Category Information

Tell customers what type of product this is:

```
## Category
- Type      : Casual / Formal coat
- Season    : Autumn, Winter
- Gender    : Unisex
```

### 3. Design Details

Describe what the product looks like and how it is made:

```
## Design Details
- Collar    : Classic lapel
- Closure   : Button front
- Pockets   : Two side pockets
- Style     : Minimal, modern luxury
```

### 4. Material & Fabric

Tell customers what materials the product is made from:

```
## Material & Fabric
- Outer     : 80% Wool, 20% Polyester
- Lining    : 100% Polyester satin
- Weight    : Medium-heavy (suitable for autumn/winter)
```

### 5. Size & Fit

Help customers choose the right size:

```
## Size & Fit
- Fit       : Regular fit
- Length    : Mid-thigh
- We recommend ordering your usual size
```

### 6. Care Instructions

Tell customers how to wash and store the product:

```
## Care Instructions
- Cleaning  : Dry clean only
- Storage   : Hang on padded hanger
- Ironing   : Low heat, use pressing cloth
- Do not tumble dry
```

## How It Looks to Customers

When a customer opens your product page, the sections you created (Design Details, Care Instructions, etc.) appear as **neat, clickable sections**. The customer can tap on any section name to open it and read the details inside.

<ManualImage src="/docs/customer_view_product.jpeg" alt="Customer product page" caption="How customers see your description — each section appears as a clean, expandable area they can tap to read" />

This keeps the page looking tidy while still giving customers all the information they need.

## Simple Tips for Better Descriptions

> **Tip:** Be specific. Instead of saying "good quality material", say "80% Wool, 20% Polyester". Customers trust specific details more than vague claims.

> **Tip:** Keep each point short. Use the list format (dash and colon) to make details easy to scan. Customers browse quickly — they do not read long paragraphs.

> **Tip:** Always include Care Instructions. Customers want to know how to take care of what they buy. It also reduces questions and complaints later.

> **Tip:** Use the same sections for all similar products. If one coat has "Design Details" and "Care Instructions", all your coats should have the same sections. This makes your store look professional and consistent.

> **Tip:** Write as if you are talking to a friend who asked "What is this product like?" Keep it natural, clear, and honest.

|---|---|
| Leaving the description empty | Always write at least a few sentences about the product |
