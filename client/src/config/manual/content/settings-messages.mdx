# Messages Settings

The **Messages** settings page lets you display a special announcement message across the top of your entire website. It is a simple way to communicate important information to every visitor — like a welcome message, a sale announcement, or a holiday notice.

## How to Get There

1. On the left side menu, click **Settings**
2. In the **Settings Dashboard** on the left, click **Messages**

## What Is the Global Message?

The global message is a **banner that appears at the very top of your website** on every page. Every single visitor will see it — whether they are on the homepage, browsing products, or checking out.

It is perfect for things like:

- Welcoming new visitors: `Welcome to Alphasuits! Free shipping on orders over Rs 5,000`
- Announcing a sale: `🎉 Big Dashain Sale — 20% off everything this week!`
- Sharing important info: `We are closed for Tihar holidays from Oct 20-25. Orders will ship after Oct 26.`
- Promoting a special offer: `Use code WELCOME10 at checkout for 10% off your first order`

## Setting Up Your Message

### Step 1: Type Your Message

1. Find the **Message** text box on the page
2. Click inside the text box
3. Type the message you want to display

Keep it short and clear — this is a banner, not a blog post. One or two sentences is ideal.

**Good examples:**
- `Welcome to Alphasuits — Premium suits tailored to perfection`
- `Free delivery on all orders above Rs 3,000`
- `New winter collection now available! Shop the latest styles`
- `🎉 Festival Sale — Up to 40% off on selected items`

**Avoid:**
- Very long messages that take up too much space on the screen
- Messages that are not relevant or useful to visitors

> **Tip:** If you want to hide the message completely, just leave the text box **empty**. An empty message means no banner will be shown on the website.

### Step 2: Set an Expiry Date (Optional)

Below the message text box, you will see an **Expiry Date (Optional)** field.

This lets you set a date after which the message will automatically disappear from your website. This is very useful for temporary announcements like sales, holidays, or limited-time offers.

**How to set an expiry date:**

1. Click on the date field
2. A calendar will appear
3. Pick the date you want the message to stop showing
4. The message will automatically hide after that date — you do not need to come back and remove it manually

**If you do not want the message to expire:**

Leave the expiry date field empty. The message will stay visible until you manually change or remove it.

> **Tip:** Always set an expiry date for time-limited announcements like sales or holiday closures. This way, you do not have to remember to come back and remove the message — it happens automatically.

### Step 3: Save Your Changes

1. Click the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner
2. Wait a moment for the changes to save
3. Open your website in a new tab to see your message at the top

> **Important:** Your message will NOT appear on the website until you click **Save Changes**. If you leave the page without saving, nothing will change.

## Editing Your Message

To change the message that is currently showing:

1. Go to **Settings → Messages**
2. Click inside the Message text box
3. Delete the old text and type your new message
4. Update the expiry date if needed
5. Click **Save Changes**

The website will immediately show the updated message.

---

## Removing Your Message

To stop showing any message on your website:

1. Go to **Settings → Messages**
2. Click inside the Message text box
3. Delete all the text so the box is completely empty
4. Click **Save Changes**

With an empty message, no banner will appear on your website.

---

## Status and Last Updated

At the bottom of the message card, you will see:

- **Last updated** — Tells you when the message was last changed (e.g., "Last updated: Today")
- **Active** badge — Shows that the message is currently being displayed on your website

This helps you keep track of how current your message is.

## Tips for Writing Good Messages

> **Tip:** Keep it under 15 words if possible. The shorter the message, the more likely visitors will actually read it.

> **Tip:** Use emojis sparingly to make your message stand out. A single 🎉 or ✨ at the start can catch the eye without looking cluttered.

> **Tip:** Change your message regularly to keep things fresh. A message that has been up for months becomes invisible — visitors stop noticing it.

> **Tip:** Match your message to what is happening right now. If you are running a sale, announce it. If you just restocked popular items, let people know. If nothing special is happening, a simple welcome message works fine.

> **Tip:** Use the expiry date for all temporary messages. It is easy to forget to remove a "Weekend Sale!" message on Monday morning — the expiry date handles it for you.

> **Tip:** Do not use the message banner for information that is already on your homepage (like your slider images). Use it for quick, important updates that visitors need to see on every page.

## Common Questions

### The message is not showing on my website. What is wrong?

Make sure you:
1. Typed something in the Message text box (an empty message will not show)
2. Clicked **Save Changes**
3. The expiry date has not already passed — if it has, the message has automatically hidden itself

### Can I show different messages on different pages?

No. The global message appears on **every page** of your website. If you need page-specific content, consider using the Events or Slider features instead.

### How do I add a link in the message?

The message is plain text only — you cannot add clickable links inside it. If you want to direct customers to a specific page, mention it in the text (e.g., "Visit our Sale page for 20% off!") and use the Slider or Events to create clickable links.

### Can I show multiple messages at the same time?

No. There is only one global message slot. If you need to communicate multiple things, combine them into one short message or prioritize the most important one.
