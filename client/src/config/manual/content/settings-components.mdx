## What Are Components?

Components are the different sections that appear on your website's homepage. Think of them as building blocks — each one shows a different type of content to your visitors. You get to decide which blocks are shown and what they say.

Here are the components you can control:

| Component | What It Shows on Your Homepage |
|---|---|
| **Store** | A section highlighting your store — great for showcasing your brand |
| **Products** | A section displaying your product catalog |
| **Recent Products** | Shows the newest products you have added |
| **Recommended Products** | Shows products you recommend to customers |
| **Trending Products** | Shows your most popular or best-selling products |

## How to Show or Hide a Section

Each component has a **toggle switch** on the right side:

- When the switch is **turned on** (colored/to the right), the section is **Visible** on your homepage — customers can see it
- When the switch is **turned off** (grey/to the left), the section is **Hidden** — customers will not see it

To change it:
1. Find the component you want to show or hide
2. Click the toggle switch to turn it on or off
3. The label next to the switch will change between "Visible" and "Hidden"

> **Tip:** You do not have to show every section. If you only have a few products, you might want to hide "Trending Products" or "Recommended Products" until you have more items in your store.

## Changing the Title and Subtitle

Each component has two text fields you can edit:

### Title

This is the **big heading** that appears above the section on your homepage. For example, the Store component might have the title "Store".

To change it:
1. Click on the **Title** text field
2. Delete the current text
3. Type your new title
4. The change will be saved when you click **Save Changes**

**Examples of good titles:**
- `Our Collection` instead of just `Products`
- `New Arrivals` instead of `Recent Products`
- `Customer Favorites` instead of `Trending Products`

### Subtitle

This is the **smaller text** that appears below the title. It gives customers a bit more detail about what the section contains.

To change it:
1. Click on the **Subtitle** text field
2. Delete the current text
3. Type your new subtitle
4. The change will be saved when you click **Save Changes**

**Examples of good subtitles:**
- `Explore our latest collection of premium suits and coats`
- `Handpicked styles just for you`
- `See what other customers are loving`

## Saving Your Changes

After you have made any changes (toggling visibility, changing titles or subtitles):

1. Click the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner of the page
2. Wait a moment for the changes to be saved
3. Your homepage will update to reflect the new settings

> **Important:** Your changes will NOT be saved until you click the **Save Changes** button. If you leave the page without saving, your changes will be lost.

---

## Last Updated

At the bottom of each component card, you will see a "Last updated" note that tells you when that component was last changed. This helps you keep track of when you last made changes.

You will also see a status badge:
- **Active** — The component is currently visible on your homepage
- **Hidden** — The component is currently not visible

## Tips for Setting Up Your Components

> **Tip:** When you are first setting up your store, start by turning on just 2-3 sections. You can always add more later as you add more products.

> **Tip:** Use titles and subtitles that match your brand's tone. If your brand is formal and professional, use titles like "Premium Collection". If your brand is casual and friendly, use titles like "Check Out Our Latest Picks".

> **Tip:** The "Store" component is great for telling visitors about your brand. Keep it visible and use a compelling subtitle like "Visit our store" or "Premium suits, tailored to perfection".

> **Tip:** If you change a title or subtitle and are not sure how it looks, open your website in a new browser tab to see the result after saving.

## Common Questions

### I turned on a section but it looks empty on the homepage. Why?

The section needs products to display. For example, "Recent Products" will only show products if you have added products recently. Add some products first, and the section will fill up automatically.

### Can I change the order of sections on the homepage?

The order of sections is fixed in the design. If you need to change the order, you will need to contact your developer.

### I accidentally hid a section. How do I bring it back?

Simply go back to **Settings → Components**, find the section, and click the toggle switch to turn it back on. Then click **Save Changes**.
