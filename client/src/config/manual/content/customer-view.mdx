# How Customers See Your Products

This section helps you understand what your customers actually see when they visit your website. Knowing this helps you make better decisions when setting up products, writing descriptions, and uploading images — because you can see the end result from the customer's point of view.

## The Product Page

When a customer clicks on one of your products, they are taken to the **product detail page**. This is where they decide whether to buy or not — so it is important that everything looks good here.

## What Customers See on the Product Page

Let's go through each part of the page from top to bottom:

### 1. Breadcrumb Navigation (Top)

At the very top, customers see a trail showing where they are on the site:

**Home → collections → product-name**

This helps them navigate back to the shop or homepage easily.

### 2. Product Images (Left Side)

The left side of the page shows your product photos. This is the biggest and most eye-catching part of the page.

- The **main image** is displayed large and clear
- Additional images are shown alongside or below, and customers can click on them to see different views
- If you tagged images with colors (for multi-variant products), only the images matching the selected color are shown

> **This is why uploading good images matters so much!** This is the main thing customers look at when deciding to buy. Make sure your photos are clear, well-lit, and show the product from multiple angles.

### 3. Product Name and Category (Right Side, Top)

On the right side, customers see:

- **Product name** — The name you entered when creating the product (e.g., "Long Sleeve Wool Coat")
- **Category** — The category you assigned (e.g., "Long Sleeve") shown just below the name

> **Tip:** This is why choosing a clear, descriptive product name matters. Customers see it right at the top of the page.

### 4. Delivery Estimate

Below the name, customers see an estimated delivery date, like:

**Delivery on 14 February - 17 February**

This gives customers a clear expectation of when they will receive their order.

### 5. Price

The price is shown prominently. If you set a discount, customers will see:

- The **sale price** in bold (e.g., **Rs 12,600**)
- The **original price** crossed out next to it (e.g., ~~Rs 14,000.00~~)

This makes the discount obvious and encourages purchases.

> **This is why setting the right price and discount matters.** The customer sees both numbers side by side, so make sure the discount is attractive but still profitable for you.

### 6. Add to Cart and Buy Now Buttons

Two main action buttons appear:

- **Add to Cart** — Adds the product to the customer's shopping cart so they can continue browsing and buy later
- **Buy now** — Takes the customer directly to checkout to purchase immediately

### 7. Wishlist Heart Icon

In the top-right corner of the product details, there is a **heart icon** (♡). Customers can click it to save the product to their wishlist for later. This is useful for customers who are interested but not ready to buy yet.

### 8. Reviews Section

Below the buttons, customers see the **Reviews** section showing:

- **Reviews count** — How many reviews the product has (e.g., "Reviews (0)")
- **Write a Review** link — Lets customers leave their own review
- **Overall rating** — The average star rating from all reviews
- **Show all** button — Expands to show all reviews

> **Tip:** Encourage happy customers to leave reviews. Products with positive reviews sell much better than products with no reviews. You can ask customers to leave a review after they receive their order.

### 9. Product Description (Expandable Sections)

Below the reviews, customers see your product description broken into **expandable sections**. Each section has a title that customers can click to expand and read the details.

Based on how you wrote your description (using `##` headings), customers might see sections like:

- **Category** — Product type, season, gender
- **Size & Fit** — Fit type, length, model measurements
- **Material & Fabric** — What the product is made of
- **Design Details** — Collar, closure, pockets, style
- **Care Instructions** — How to clean and store the product

Each section starts **collapsed** (closed) so the page is not cluttered. Customers click on any section title to open it and read the details inside.

> **This is why writing good descriptions with proper headings matters!** Each `##` heading you write in the description becomes one of these clean, expandable sections. Well-organized descriptions make customers feel confident about the product.

### 10. "You May Also Like" Section

Below the product details, there is a **"You may also like"** section that shows other products the customer might be interested in. This is generated automatically based on related products in your store.

> **Tip:** The more products you have in your store, the better this section works. It encourages customers to browse more and potentially buy additional items.

## Color and Size Selection (Multi-Variant Products)

If your product has multiple variants (different sizes and colors), customers will see:

### Color Selection

- Small **colored dots** appear on the page, each representing a color option you set up
- The customer clicks on a dot to select that color
- When they select a different color, the **product images change** to show photos of that color (if you tagged your images properly)

### Size Selection

- **Size buttons** appear showing all available sizes (e.g., S, M, L, XL, XXL, 3XL)
- The customer clicks the size they want
- Sizes that are **out of stock** may appear grayed out or unavailable

### Price Changes

- When the customer selects a different size or color combination, the **price may change** to match that specific variant's price
- The stock availability also updates — if that particular variant is out of stock, they will be told

> **This is why setting up variants correctly matters!** Every size and color combination needs the right price and stock count. And every color needs properly tagged images. When everything is set up correctly, the customer gets a smooth, professional shopping experience.

## The Shop Page

Before customers reach the product page, they browse the **shop page** (also called the collections page). Here they see all your products displayed as cards in a grid.

Each product card shows:

- **Product image** — The main image you uploaded
- **Product name** — The name you gave the product
- **Price** — With the discount shown if applicable
- **Quick actions** — Options to add to cart or wishlist

Customers can use **filters** (the ones you set up in Settings → Filters) to narrow down products by category and color.

> **This is why your main product image is so important!** On the shop page, customers only see one image per product. That one image needs to convince them to click and learn more.

---

## The Homepage

Your homepage is the front door of your store. Customers see:

1. **Slider images** — The banner images you set up in Settings → Slider
2. **Global message** — The announcement you set up in Settings → Messages (shown at the top)
3. **Event banners** — The promotional events you created in Settings → Events
4. **Product sections** — The sections you enabled in Settings → Components (like "Products", "Recent Products", "Trending Products")
5. **Newsletter signup** — Where customers can enter their email to receive updates
6. **Footer** — Your brand info, links to About, Contacts, FAQ, and social media

> **Tip:** Visit your own website regularly as if you were a customer. See how things look, try browsing and filtering products, and check if everything works smoothly. If something looks off or confusing, fix it in the admin panel.

## Why This All Matters

Everything you do in the admin panel directly affects what customers see:

| What You Do in Admin | What Customers See |
|---|---|
| Upload a great product photo | A beautiful image that makes them want to buy |
| Write a detailed description with headings | Clean, organized product details they can easily browse |
| Set up color variants with tagged images | The right images show when they select a color |

| Add a global message | An announcement at the top of every page |
| Set up slider images | A professional-looking homepage banner |
| Create events | Eye-catching promotional banners |
| Set up filters | Easy browsing and product discovery |

> **Tip:** The better your product pages look, the more customers will trust your store and the more sales you will make. Take time to upload quality images, write thorough descriptions, and keep your prices and stock up to date.

## Quick Checklist: Does My Product Look Good to Customers?

Before you consider a product ready, open it on your website and check:

- [ ] Does the main image look clear and professional?
- [ ] Are there multiple images showing different angles?
- [ ] Does the product name clearly describe what it is?
- [ ] Is the price displayed correctly (with discount if applicable)?
