# Sales & Orders

Every time a customer buys something from your store, it creates an order (also called a sale). The **Sales** page is where you see all your orders, check their status, and manage them from start to finish.

## How to Get to the Sales Page

1. On the left side menu, click **Sales**
2. The Sales page opens showing all your orders

## Understanding Order Statuses

Every order has a status that tells you where it is in the process. Here are all the possible statuses:

| Status | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Unpaid** | The customer started an order but has not paid yet |
| **Pending** | The customer has paid, and the order is waiting for you to process it |
| **Confirmed** | You have confirmed the order and it is being prepared |
| **In Progress** | The order is being packed or prepared for delivery |
| **Completed** | The order is ready and has been packed |
| **Delivered** | The order has been delivered to the customer |
| **Cancelled** | The order was cancelled — either by the customer or by you |

Orders move through these statuses step by step, from Unpaid/Pending all the way to Delivered.

## Viewing Your Orders

### List View

By default, orders are shown in a **table list**. Each row shows:

- **Order number** — A unique number for each order
- **Customer name** — Who placed the order
- **Contact details** — Phone number and email
- **Status** — The current status of the order (shown as a colored badge)
- **Amount** — How much the customer paid
- **Date** — When the order was placed

### Kanban View

You can also switch to a **Kanban view** (board view) which shows orders as cards organized by their status in columns. This gives you a visual overview of all your orders at each stage.

---

## Searching for an Order

At the top of the page, there is a **search bar** where you can look up any order by:

- Customer name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Bill number

Just type what you are looking for and the list will filter to show matching orders.

## Updating an Order's Status

When an order moves to the next stage, you need to update its status:

1. Find the order in the list
2. Click on the order to open its details
3. Change the status to the next step (for example, from "Pending" to "Confirmed")
4. Save the changes

The status badges are color-coded so you can quickly see which orders need your attention:

- **Yellow** badges (Pending) — These need your action! Confirm them as soon as possible.
- **Blue** badges (In Progress) — These are being worked on.
- **Green** badges (Delivered) — These are done. No action needed.
- **Red** badges (Cancelled) — These have been cancelled.

> **Tip:** Check the Sales page at least once a day. Customers expect quick order processing. The faster you confirm and ship orders, the happier your customers will be.

---

## Viewing Order Details

Click on any order to see its full details:

- **Customer information** — Name, email, phone number, delivery address
- **Products ordered** — Which products they bought, the size, color, and quantity
- **Payment details** — How much they paid and the payment method
- **Order timeline** — When the order was placed and any status changes

---

## Deleting an Order

You can only delete orders that are **Cancelled** or **Unpaid**. You cannot delete orders that are in progress or delivered.

To delete an order:

1. Find the cancelled or unpaid order
2. Click the delete option (trash icon or "Delete Order" in the menu)
3. A confirmation message will appear asking if you are sure
4. Click **Confirm** to delete it

> **Important:** When you delete a cancelled order, the stock is automatically restored. For example, if a customer ordered 2 coats and then cancelled, deleting that order will add those 2 coats back to your inventory.

---

## Filtering Orders by Status

You can filter the order list to show only orders with a specific status:

1. Look for the **status filter** dropdown near the search bar
2. Select a status (e.g., "Pending" to see only pending orders)
3. The list updates to show only orders matching that status

This is very useful when you want to focus on specific tasks, like:
- Seeing all **Pending** orders that need to be confirmed
- Checking all **In Progress** orders that need to be shipped
- Reviewing all **Cancelled** orders

## Tips for Managing Orders

> **Tip:** Process pending orders as quickly as possible. A fast response builds trust with your customers.

> **Tip:** If a customer contacts you about their order, use the search bar to quickly find it by their name, phone number, or email.

> **Tip:** Before confirming an order, make sure you actually have the items in stock. If something is out of stock, contact the customer and offer alternatives or a refund.

> **Tip:** Keep your cancelled orders cleaned up. Periodically delete old cancelled orders to keep your Sales page organized and your stock numbers accurate.

> **Tip:** If you use the Kanban view, you can get a quick visual picture of how many orders are at each stage. If too many are piling up in "Pending", it means you need to process them faster.

## Common Questions

### A customer wants to change their order. What do I do?

Contact the customer directly (by phone or email from the order details). If the change is possible, update the order. If not, you may need to cancel the old order and ask them to place a new one.

### A customer says they never received their order but it shows as "Delivered". What do I do?

Check the delivery details and contact your delivery partner. If the order was truly lost, you may need to send a replacement or issue a refund.

### Why can I not delete a "Delivered" order?

Delivered orders are part of your sales history. They are kept for your records, accounting, and analytics. Only Cancelled and Unpaid orders can be deleted.
