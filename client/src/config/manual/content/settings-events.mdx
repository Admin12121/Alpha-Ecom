## What Are Events?

Events are special announcements that appear on your website. They are used to grab your customers' attention and tell them about something exciting — like a sale, a new collection launch, or a festival discount.

Each event has:

- **A title** — The name of the event (e.g., "Big Sale", "Dashain Special", "New Arrivals")
- **A color** — A background color that makes the event stand out (e.g., red for sales, green for festivals)
- **A description** — A short message explaining what the event is about

## How Many Events Can I Have?

You can have between **1 and 2 events** active at the same time.

- Having 1-2 events keeps things focused
- Too many events would overwhelm your customers
- You can always change or replace events as new promotions come up

---

## Creating a New Event

1. Click the **+ Add Event** button in the top-right area
2. A new event entry will appear with three fields to fill in
3. Fill in each field (see details below)
4. Click **Save Changes** when you are done

### Title

This is the name of your event. Keep it short and catchy — it needs to grab attention quickly.

**Good examples:**
- `Big Sale`
- `Dashain Offer`
- `Winter Collection Launch`
- `Buy 2 Get 1 Free`

**Avoid:**
- Very long titles that are hard to read at a glance
- Vague titles like "Event" or "Announcement" that do not tell the customer anything

### Color

The color is the background color of your event banner on the website. It helps the event stand out and sets the mood.

To choose a color:

1. Click the **Choose Color** button next to the color preview
2. A color picker will appear
3. Click on the color you want, or type a specific color code if you have one
4. The preview box next to the button will update to show your selected color

**Suggested colors for different types of events:**

| Event Type | Suggested Color |
|---|---|
| Sales and discounts | Red or Orange — creates urgency |
| New arrivals or launches | Blue or Purple — feels fresh and exciting |
| Festivals and celebrations | Gold or Green — feels festive |
| Limited-time offers | Red or Pink — grabs immediate attention |

> **Tip:** Choose colors that contrast well with your website's design so the event banner stands out. Bright colors like red and orange catch the eye best.

### Description

This is a short message that tells customers what the event is about. Keep it brief and clear — 1 to 2 sentences is perfect.

**Good examples:**
- `Big Sale — Up to 50% off on all winter coats! Limited time only.`
- `Celebrate Dashain with our exclusive collection. Special discounts on all suits.`
- `New premium wool coats just arrived. Shop the latest styles now.`

**Avoid:**
- Very long paragraphs — customers will not read them
- Overly vague descriptions like "Something exciting is coming" — tell them what it actually is

> **Important:** Always click **Save Changes** after making any updates. If you leave the page without saving, your changes will be lost.

---

## Last Updated

At the bottom of each event entry, you will see a **"Last updated"** note. This tells you when the event was last changed, helping you keep track of how current your events are.

---

## Tips for Creating Effective Events

> **Tip:** Change your events regularly to keep your website feeling fresh. An event that has been up for months looks outdated.

> **Tip:** Time your events with real promotions. If you announce a "Big Sale" event, make sure you actually have discounted products ready for customers to buy.

> **Tip:** Use the event description to create urgency. Phrases like "Limited time only", "This week only", or "While stocks last" encourage customers to buy sooner.

> **Tip:** Match your event color with the mood. Red for urgent sales, green for seasonal collections, gold for premium launches.

> **Tip:** Keep your event title under 5 words. Short titles are easier to read and more impactful.

## Common Questions

### My event is not showing on the website. What happened?

Make sure you clicked **Save Changes** after creating the event. If you did save and it is still not showing, try refreshing your website.

### Can I have more than 2 events?

No, the system allows a maximum of 2 events at a time. If you want to add a new event but already have 2, you will need to delete one of the existing events first.

### How long should I keep an event active?

This depends on the promotion. For a weekend sale, keep it up for 3-4 days. For a seasonal collection, you might keep it up for a few weeks. The key is to remove or replace events once they are no longer relevant.
