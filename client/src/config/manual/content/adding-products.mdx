# Adding a Product

Adding a product is one of the most important tasks you will perform as an admin. This guide walks you through every single field and option on the **Add Product** page so you can create complete, well-organized product listings that look great to your customers.

---

## Accessing the Add Product Page

1. Click **Products** in the left sidebar to expand the submenu
2. Click **Add Products**
3. You will see the Add Product form with sections for General Information, Images, Product Type, Pricing, and Category

## Step 1: Enter General Information

### Product Name

The **Product Name** field is at the top of the form. This is the name customers will see when browsing your store.

- Type a clear, descriptive name for your product
- Example: `Long Sleeve Wool Coat`, `Classic Black Suit`, `Slim Fit Formal Shirt`
- Keep it concise but descriptive — include the key attributes like color, style, or material

> **Tip:** Good product names help customers find your products through search. Include relevant keywords like "wool", "slim fit", "formal", etc.

### Product Description

The **Product Description** field is a large text area below the product name. This is where you describe your product in detail. The description supports **Markdown formatting**, which lets you create structured, easy-to-read content.

We cover description writing in depth in the **Writing Descriptions** section, but here is a quick overview:

- Use `##` for section headers (e.g., `## Design Details`)
- Use `-` for bullet point lists
- Use `**bold text**` to emphasize important details
- You can include hashtags at the top for quick tags (e.g., `#white #small`)

## Step 2: Upload Product Images

On the right side of the form, you will see the **Images** section. This is where you upload photos of your product.

### How to Upload Images

There are **two ways** to upload images:

1. **Click to Upload** — Click anywhere in the image area (it says "Click or Drop here") to open your computer's file browser. Select one or more image files.

2. **Drag and Drop** — Drag image files from your computer directly onto the image area.

### Image Slots

- The **large area at the top** is for the main product image — this is the primary photo customers will see first
- Below the main image, there are **smaller slots** (marked with `+` icons) for additional product images
- You can upload up to **5 images** per product

### Removing Images

- Hover over any uploaded image to see a **red delete button** (trash icon) appear in the top-right corner
- Click it to remove that image
- You can also click **Remove All** (appears in the top-right when images are uploaded) to clear all images at once

> **Important:** Always upload at least one high-quality image. Products without images get significantly fewer views and sales. Use well-lit photos with a clean background for the best results.

> **Tip:** For the best quality, use images that are at least **800×1000 pixels**. The system will automatically resize them, but starting with a high-resolution image ensures they look crisp on all devices.

## Step 3: Choose Product Type

Below the description, you will see the **Product Type** selector with two options:

### Single Variant

This is the **default** option (highlighted in purple). Use this when your product comes in only **one version** — one size, one color, one price.

**When to use Single Variant:**
- The product has no size or color options
- You are selling a one-of-a-kind item
- The product is an accessory like a tie, belt, or cufflinks with no variations

### Multi Variant

Click **Multi Variant** when your product comes in **multiple sizes, colors, or both**. This unlocks the full variant management system where you can define different combinations of size, color, price, stock, and discount for each variant.

**When to use Multi Variant:**
- A coat available in sizes S, M, L, XL, XXL
- A suit available in Navy, Black, and White colors
- A shirt available in multiple size-color combinations, each with its own stock level

We cover Multi Variant setup in detail in the **Product Variants** section.

## Step 4: Set Pricing and Stock

### For Single Variant Products

The **Pricing And Stock** section shows three fields:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | The selling price of the product in Rs. Enter only the number, no currency symbol needed | `14000` |
| **Stock** | How many units you have available for sale | `5` |
| **Discount** | The discount percentage to apply (enter `0` for no discount) | `15` |

**How Discount Works:**
- If you set the price to **14000** and the discount to **15**, the customer will see:
  - Original price: ~~Rs 14,000~~ (crossed out)
  - Sale price: **Rs 12,600** (automatically calculated as 14000 - 15%)
- Setting discount to `0` means no discount — the product is sold at full price

> **Important:** The **Stock** value determines how many units customers can purchase. When stock reaches **0**, the product will show as "Out of Stock" and customers cannot add it to their cart. Always keep your stock numbers accurate.

### For Multi Variant Products

When you select **Multi Variant**, the Pricing section changes to show variant-level fields. Each variant gets its own Price, Stock, and Discount. See the **Product Variants** section for full details.

## Step 5: Select a Category

On the right side, below the images, you will find the **Category** section.

1. Click the **Select a Category** dropdown
2. Choose from your existing categories (e.g., "Long Sleeve", "Luxury Coat")
3. The category is assigned to your product immediately

### Adding a New Category Inline

If the category you need does not exist yet, you can create it right from the Add Product page:

1. Click the **Add** button next to the category dropdown
2. A dialog box will appear with a text field labeled "Enter category"
3. Type the name of your new category
4. Click **Add Category**
5. The new category will be created and automatically selected for your product

<ManualImage src="/docs/create_category.jpeg" alt="Add Category dialog" caption="The Add Category dialog that appears when you click the Add button — simply type the category name and click Add Category" />

> **Tip:** Keep category names clear and consistent. Use names like "Formal Shirts", "Casual Coats", "Winter Collection" rather than vague names like "Category 1" or "Misc".

---

## Step 6: Save the Product

Once you have filled in all the required fields:

1. Review everything — make sure the name, description, images, price, stock, and category are all correct
2. Click the **Save Product** button in the top-right corner of the page
3. If everything is valid, you will see a success notification and the product will be created
4. If there are validation errors (e.g., missing category), the form will highlight the issues in **red text** — fix them and try saving again

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's a Problem | How to Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No images uploaded | Products without images look unprofessional and get very few sales | Always upload at least 1 high-quality image |
| Empty description | Customers need details to make a purchase decision | Write a thorough description with design details, materials, and care instructions |
| Stock set to 0 | Product shows as "Out of Stock" immediately | Set the correct inventory count |
| Discount set too high | You might sell at a loss | Double-check the calculated sale price before saving |
| No category selected | Product won't appear in category-based filters | Always assign a category — create a new one if needed |

---

## What Happens After Saving?

After you save a product:

- It appears in the **Products** list (sidebar → Products → Products)
- It becomes visible to customers on your store immediately
- Customers can add it to their cart, wishlist, and purchase it
- Stock will automatically decrease as customers buy the product
- You can edit the product at any time by clicking on it in the Products list
