## Creating a New Discount Code

Fill in each field in the **Add Redeem Code** form:

### Name

Give your discount a name so you can remember what it is for. This name is just for you — customers will not see it.

- Example: `Summer Sale`, `First Order Discount`, `Festival Special`

### Code

This is the actual code that customers will type at checkout. Make it short, easy to remember, and easy to type.

- Example: `SUMMER20`, `WELCOME10`, `NEWYEAR`
- Use capital letters and numbers — avoid spaces or special characters

> **Tip:** Keep codes simple. `SAVE20` is much easier for a customer to type than `SUPER-SPECIAL-DISCOUNT-2024`.

### Type

Choose what kind of discount this code gives:

- **Percentage** — Takes a percentage off the total (e.g., 20% off)
- **Fixed Amount** — Takes a fixed amount off the total (e.g., Rs 500 off)

Select the type from the dropdown menu.

### Discount

Enter the discount value:

- If you chose **Percentage**, enter the number without the % sign. For example, enter `20` for 20% off.
- If you chose **Fixed Amount**, enter the amount in Rs. For example, enter `500` for Rs 500 off.

### Minimum

This is the minimum order amount required to use this code. If a customer's order is below this amount, the code will not work.

- Enter `0` if there is no minimum — the code works on any order
- Enter `1000` if the customer must spend at least Rs 1,000 to use the code

> **Tip:** Setting a minimum order amount encourages customers to add more items to their cart to qualify for the discount.

### Limit

This is the maximum number of times this code can be used in total across all customers.

- Enter `0` for unlimited uses — the code can be used as many times as customers want
- Enter `100` if you only want the code to work 100 times total
- Once the limit is reached, the code stops working automatically

### Valid Until

This is the expiry date for the code. After this date, the code will stop working.

1. Click the date field
2. A calendar will appear
3. Pick the date you want the code to expire
4. If you leave this empty, the code never expires

## Saving the Discount Code

Once you have filled in all the fields:

1. Double-check everything — especially the code, discount amount, and expiry date
2. Click the **Add** button
3. Your discount code is now active and ready for customers to use

## Example: Creating a 20% Off Code

Let's say you want to create a discount code for a summer sale:

| Field | What to Enter |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Summer Sale |
| **Code** | SUMMER20 |
| **Type** | Percentage |
| **Discount** | 20 |
| **Minimum** | 2000 |
| **Limit** | 50 |
| **Valid Until** | Pick the last day of summer |

This creates a code called `SUMMER20` that gives 20% off on orders above Rs 2,000, can be used up to 50 times, and expires at the end of summer.

## Managing Existing Codes

Below the creation form, you will see a list of all your existing discount codes. From here you can:

- **View** the details of each code (name, code, discount, usage count, expiry)
- **Delete** a code if you no longer want it to be active

## Tips for Using Discount Codes

> **Tip:** Share your discount codes on your social media pages (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) to attract more customers.

> **Tip:** Create special codes for festivals and holidays like Dashain, Tihar, or New Year to boost sales during peak shopping times.

> **Tip:** Use the **Limit** field to create urgency. When customers know only 50 codes are available, they are more likely to buy quickly.

> **Tip:** Track which codes are being used the most. This tells you which promotions are working and which channels are bringing in customers.

> **Tip:** Do not share too many discount codes at once. If customers always expect a discount, they will stop buying at full price.

## Common Questions

### Can a customer use two codes on the same order?

No. Only one discount code can be applied per order.

### What happens if I delete a code while a customer is shopping?

If the customer has not completed checkout yet, the code will stop working. Already completed orders are not affected.

### Can I edit a code after creating it?

You need to delete the old code and create a new one with the updated details.
