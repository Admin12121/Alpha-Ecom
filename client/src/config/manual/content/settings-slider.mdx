# Slider Settings

The **Slider** is the big banner area at the very top of your homepage. It is the first thing visitors see when they open your website. You can add beautiful images that scroll automatically, and each image can link to a specific page on your site.

## How to Get There

1. On the left side menu, click **Settings**
2. In the **Settings Dashboard** on the left, click **Slider**
3. The Slider settings page opens

## What Is the Slider?

The slider is like a digital billboard on your homepage. It shows large, beautiful images that automatically scroll one by one. Think of it like a slideshow.

Each slider image can also have a **link** — so when a customer clicks on the image, they are taken to a specific page (like a sale page, a product collection, or any other page on your site).

## How Many Images Can I Add?

You can have between **1 and 6 slider images**.

- You must have **at least 1 image** — the slider cannot be empty
- You can have **up to 6 images** — adding more keeps the homepage fresh and interesting

> **Tip:** 2-4 images is usually the sweet spot. Too many images means customers might not see the later ones before scrolling down.

## Adding a New Slider Image

1. Click the **+ Add Image** button in the top-right area
2. A new slider entry will appear with two fields:
   - **Image URL** — The web address of your image
   - **Link URL (Optional)** — The page you want customers to go to when they click the image
3. Fill in the fields (see details below)
4. Click **Save Changes** when you are done

### Image URL

This is the web address (URL) where your banner image is hosted. Paste the full image link here.

**How to get an image URL:**
- If you have uploaded the image to your server or a hosting service, copy the link
- The URL usually ends in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp`
- Example: `https://yoursite.com/images/summer-sale-banner.jpg`

> **Tip:** Use wide, landscape-oriented images for the slider. The recommended size is **1920 × 600 pixels** — this ensures the image looks great on all screen sizes without being too tall or too short.

### Link URL (Optional)

This is the page that opens when a customer clicks on the slider image. If you leave this empty, clicking the image will do nothing.

**Examples of useful links:**
- `/` — Takes the customer to the homepage
- `/collections` — Takes them to your shop page
- `/collections/winter-sale` — Takes them to a specific collection

> **Tip:** Use slider links to direct customers to your latest sale, new arrivals, or a seasonal collection. A beautiful banner image with a link to a sale page can significantly boost sales.

## Understanding the Slider Layout

Each slider image entry shows:

1. **A header** — "Slider Image 1", "Slider Image 2", etc.
2. **Image URL field** — Where you paste the image address
3. **Link URL field** — Where you paste the link (optional)
4. **Preview area** — A preview of what the image looks like. This helps you confirm the image is correct before saving.
5. **Delete button** — A red trash icon in the top-right corner of each entry to remove that image

---

## Previewing Your Images

Below the URL fields for each slider entry, you will see a **Preview** section. This shows you exactly what the image will look like on your homepage.

- If the image loads correctly, you will see it displayed in the preview area
- If the image URL is wrong or broken, the preview will show a blank or error state

> **Tip:** Always check the preview before saving. If the preview looks wrong, double-check that you pasted the correct image URL.

## Removing a Slider Image

To remove a slider image:

1. Find the slider entry you want to remove (e.g., "Slider Image 2")
2. Click the **red trash icon** (🗑) in the top-right corner of that entry
3. The entry is removed
4. Click **Save Changes** to save the updated slider

> **Important:** You must always have at least 1 slider image. You cannot delete the last remaining image.

---

## Changing the Order of Images

Slider images are shown in the order they appear in the settings (Image 1 first, Image 2 second, and so on). To change the order, you would need to update the image URLs so the image you want to show first is in the "Slider Image 1" position.

---

## Saving Your Changes

After adding, removing, or editing any slider images:

1. Click the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner
2. Wait a moment for the changes to be saved
3. Open your website in a new tab to see the updated slider

> **Important:** Your changes will NOT appear on your website until you click **Save Changes**. If you leave the page without saving, your changes will be lost.

## Tips for Great Slider Images

> **Tip:** Use high-quality, professional photos. The slider is the first thing visitors see — make a great first impression.

> **Tip:** Keep text on images minimal. If the image has text, make sure it is large and easy to read on both phones and computers.

> **Tip:** Change your slider images regularly — at least once a month. Fresh images keep your homepage looking current and give returning visitors something new to see.

> **Tip:** Match your slider images to your current promotions. If you are running a winter sale, use a winter-themed banner. If you just launched a new collection, showcase it in the slider.

> **Tip:** Make sure your images look good on mobile phones too. Most of your customers will visit your site from their phone, so test how the slider looks on a smaller screen.

## Common Questions

### My image is not showing in the preview. What is wrong?

The image URL might be incorrect or the image might not be accessible. Double-check that:
- The URL is complete and correct (starts with `https://`)
- The image is publicly accessible (not behind a login)
- The URL ends with an image file extension like `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp`

### How big should my slider images be?

The ideal size is **1920 × 600 pixels**. This gives a wide, cinematic look that works well on all screen sizes. If your image is a different size, it will be resized automatically, but it might not look as sharp.

### Can I use images from my phone?

You would first need to upload the image somewhere online (like your server or an image hosting service) and then use that URL. You cannot upload images directly from your phone to the slider settings.
