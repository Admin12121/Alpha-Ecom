| **Pending** | Bookings waiting for you to confirm — these need your attention |
| **Confirmed** | Bookings you have confirmed — the appointment is set |
| **In Progress** | The customer is currently being served (in-store or during a home visit) |
| **Completed** | The appointment is finished — measurements have been taken |
| **Delivered** | The final product has been delivered to the customer |
| **Cancelled** | Bookings that were cancelled |

The main area shows a table with all your bookings. Each row shows:

| Column | What It Shows |

| **Contact** | Their phone number and email address |
| **Appointment** | The date, time, and type of appointment (In-Store or Home Visit) |

| **Actions** | Buttons to view details or delete the booking |

## Viewing Booking Details and Recording Measurements

This is the most important part of managing bookings. When a customer comes in for measurements, you need to open their booking and record their body measurements.

### How to Open a Booking

1. Find the booking in the list
2. Click the **eye icon** (👁) in the Actions column
3. A detailed panel opens showing everything about this booking

<ManualImage src="/docs/mesurement_data.jpeg" alt="Booking details with measurements" caption="The Booking Details panel showing customer information on the left and the measurement recording form on the right" />

### What You See in the Booking Details

The panel is split into two halves:

**Left Side — Customer Information:**
- **Name** — The customer's name
- **Email** — Their email address
- **Phone** — Their phone number
- **Location** — Where they are located
- **Appointment Date** — The date of the appointment
- **Time** — The scheduled time
- **Type** — In-Store or Home Visit
- **Booked On** — When they made the booking

**Right Side — Record Measurements:**

This is where you enter the customer's body measurements.

---

## How to Record Measurements

### Step 1: Set the Status

At the top of the right side, you will see:

- **Status** — A dropdown to change the booking status (e.g., from Pending to Confirmed or In Progress)
- **Expected Delivery** — A date field where you set when the customer can expect their finished product

### Step 2: Choose the Garment Type

You will see tabs for different types of garments:

- **Coat & Safari** — For coats, safari suits, and similar outerwear
- **Pant** — For trousers and pants
- **Shirt** — For shirts

Click on the tab for the garment you are measuring.

### Step 3: Enter the Measurements

Each garment type has a measurement table with two columns (**A** and **B**) and rows for different body measurements. The rows change depending on the garment type.

For **Coat & Safari**, the measurement rows are:

| Label | What to Measure |
|---|---|
| **L** | Length — from the back of the neck to the desired coat length |
| **C** | Chest — around the fullest part of the chest |
| **W** | Waist — around the natural waistline |
| **H** | Hip — around the fullest part of the hips |
| **S** | Shoulder — from one shoulder edge to the other |
| **B** | Bicep — around the fullest part of the upper arm |
| **SL** | Sleeve Length — from the shoulder to the wrist |
| **N** | Neck — around the base of the neck |

The **A** and **B** columns let you record measurements from two different measurement sessions or two different measuring methods for accuracy.

### How to Enter Values

1. Click on any cell in the table
2. Type the measurement number (in centimeters or inches, depending on your preference)
3. Move to the next cell and repeat
4. Do this for every measurement row

> **Tip:** Measure each area twice and enter both readings in columns A and B. This helps catch any measurement errors. If both numbers are close, the measurement is accurate.

### Step 4: Add a Message (Optional)

Below the measurement table, there is a **"Message to Customer (optional)"** text box. You can type a note here that will be sent to the customer. For example:
- "Your suit is on the way!"
- "We need you to come in for a fitting next week"
- "Your measurements have been recorded, expected delivery in 2 weeks"

### Step 5: Send Email Notification (Optional)

Below the message box, there is a checkbox that says **"Send email notification to customer"**. If you check this box, the customer will receive an email with any status update or message you entered.

### Step 6: Save

Click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom to save everything — the measurements, status change, expected delivery date, and message.

If you do not want to save, click **Cancel** to close the panel without saving.

## Updating Booking Status

As a booking moves through the process, update its status:

1. **Pending** → Customer just booked, waiting for your confirmation
2. **Confirmed** → You confirmed the appointment
3. **In Progress** → The appointment is happening or the garment is being made
4. **Completed** → Everything is done
5. **Delivered** → The finished product has been given to the customer

To change the status:
1. Open the booking details (click the eye icon)
2. Use the **Status** dropdown on the right side
3. Select the new status
4. Click **Save Changes**

---

## Deleting a Booking

If you need to remove a booking:

1. Find the booking in the list
2. Click the **trash icon** (🗑) in the Actions column
3. Confirm that you want to delete it

> **Warning:** Deleting a booking removes it permanently. You cannot get it back. Only delete bookings that were made by mistake or that the customer requested to cancel.

---

## Refreshing the Bookings List

Click the **Refresh** button in the top-right corner to reload the bookings list and see the latest data. This is useful if you think a new booking might have come in while you were looking at the page.

## Tips for Managing Bookings

> **Tip:** Check for new **Pending** bookings at least twice a day. Customers expect a quick response when they book an appointment.

> **Tip:** Always confirm the appointment date and time with the customer before changing the status to "Confirmed".

> **Tip:** When recording measurements, take your time and double-check each number. Wrong measurements lead to wrong-sized garments and unhappy customers.

> **Tip:** Use the **Expected Delivery** date to set realistic expectations. It is better to deliver early than late. Give yourself a buffer.

> **Tip:** Use the email notification feature to keep customers informed. A simple message like "Your measurements have been recorded and your coat will be ready by March 15" goes a long way in building trust.

> **Tip:** For Home Visit bookings, make sure to contact the customer beforehand to confirm the address and a convenient time.

## Common Questions

### A customer wants to reschedule their booking. What do I do?

Contact the customer to agree on a new date and time. Then update the booking details accordingly, or delete the old booking and ask the customer to make a new one.

### The measurements look wrong. Can I change them later?

Yes! Open the booking details again at any time and update the measurement values. Just remember to click **Save Changes** after making corrections.

### Can a customer see their measurements?

Customers can see the status of their booking and any messages you send. The detailed measurement numbers are primarily for your internal use when creating the garment.
