# Dashboard Overview

The **Dashboard** is the first screen you see when you log into the admin panel. It gives you a complete snapshot of your store's performance — revenue, orders, users, and recent activity — all in one place.

## Key Metrics Cards

At the very top of the dashboard, you will see **four summary cards** that give you instant insights:

| Card | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| **Total Revenue** | The total revenue your store has earned across all time, with a percentage change from last month |
| **Monthly Revenue** | Revenue earned during the current month only |
| **Total Orders** | The total number of orders placed, including how many are currently pending |
| **Active Users** | The number of registered users on your platform, with new users added this month |

These cards update automatically as new orders come in and users register.

## Dashboard Tabs

Below the summary cards, you will find **three tabs** that let you switch between different views:

### 1. Overview Tab (Default)

The Overview tab is selected by default and shows:

- **Revenue Overview** — A line chart showing your daily revenue over the current month. The X-axis shows dates and the Y-axis shows revenue in Rs. This helps you identify sales trends and peak days.

- **Order Status** — A visual breakdown of the distribution of your active orders (pending, confirmed, in progress, completed, delivered, cancelled).

- **Recent Orders** — A table listing the latest customer orders with columns for:
  - Order number
  - Customer name
  - Order status
  - Total amount

- **Top Products** — Shows your best-selling products ranked by the quantity sold. This helps you understand which items are most popular with customers.

- **Recent Bookings** — A table of the latest customer appointment bookings showing:
  - Booking ID
  - Customer name
  - Booking type (In-Store or Home Visit)
  - Preferred date and time
  - Current status

### 2. Analytics Tab

<ManualImage src="/docs/dashboard_analytics.jpeg" alt="Dashboard Analytics Tab" caption="The Analytics tab showing category performance and daily visitor traffic" />

The Analytics tab gives you deeper insights into your store:

- **Category Performance** — A chart showing revenue broken down by product category. This helps you understand which product types (e.g., coats, shirts, pants) are generating the most sales.

- **Daily Visitors** — A line chart showing your site traffic over the last 7 days. The chart plots the number of visitors per day so you can see when your site gets the most traffic.

### 3. Reports Tab

The Reports tab provides downloadable reports and detailed breakdowns of your store data. You can use this for accounting, tax purposes, or to share performance data with your team.

## Date Range Filter

In the top-right corner of the dashboard, you will see a **date range selector** that defaults to "This Month". You can change this to view data for different time periods:

- This Month
- Last Month
- Custom date range

Next to the date selector, there is a **download button** (arrow icon) that lets you export the current dashboard data.

## Tips for Using the Dashboard

> **Tip:** Check the dashboard at least once a day to stay on top of pending orders, low-stock alerts, and new bookings.

> **Tip:** Use the Analytics tab weekly to identify which product categories are performing well and adjust your inventory accordingly.

> **Tip:** If "Total Orders" shows pending orders, navigate to **Sales** from the sidebar to process them promptly. Quick order fulfillment leads to happy customers.

## What to Do Next

- If you see **pending orders**, go to **Sales** to process them
- If **Active Users** is growing, make sure your product catalog is up to date
- If revenue is flat, consider creating **Events** or **Discount Coupons** to drive sales
- Check **Bookings** if you have pending measurement appointments

Now let's move on to **Managing Users** to learn how to view and control user accounts.
