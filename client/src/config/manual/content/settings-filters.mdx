# Filters Settings

The **Filters** settings page lets you set up the filtering options that customers use to narrow down products while shopping. You can create **category filters** and **color filters** so customers can quickly find exactly what they are looking for.

## How to Get There

1. On the left side menu, click **Settings**
2. In the **Settings Dashboard** on the left, click **Filters**
3. The Filters settings page opens

## What Are Filters?

When customers visit your shop page, they see all your products at once. Filters let them narrow down the list. For example:

- A customer looking for **coats** can filter by the "Coats" category to hide shirts, pants, and other items
- A customer looking for something in **black** can filter by the "Black" color to only see black products

Without filters, customers have to scroll through everything — which is frustrating, especially when you have a lot of products.

---

## Two Types of Filters

The Filters page has **two tabs** at the top:

1. **Categories** — Filters based on product type (like "Formal Suits", "Casual Wear", etc.)
2. **Colors** — Filters based on product color (like "Black", "Navy", "White", etc.)

Click on either tab to switch between them.

## Setting Up Category Filters

Category filters let customers filter products by type. These are separate from the product categories you created in the Products section — these are specifically for the **filter sidebar** on your shop page.

### Adding a New Category Filter

1. Make sure you are on the **Categories** tab
2. Click the **+ Add Category** button on the right side
3. A new row will appear in the table
4. Type the name of the category filter (e.g., "Formal", "Casual", "Winter Collection")
5. Click **Save Changes** in the top-right corner

### Editing a Category Filter

1. Find the category filter you want to change in the list
2. Click on its name to edit it
3. Type the new name
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Removing a Category Filter

1. Find the category filter you want to remove
2. Click the action button (edit or delete icon) in the **Actions** column on the right
3. The filter is removed from the list
4. Click **Save Changes** to confirm

## Setting Up Color Filters

<ManualImage src="/docs/filter_color_setting.jpeg" alt="Color Filters settings" caption="The Filters page showing the Colors tab where you add color-based filter options for your store" />

Color filters let customers filter products by color. When you add a color filter, it appears as a colored dot or swatch on the shop page that customers can click to see only products in that color.

### Adding a New Color Filter

1. Click on the **Colors** tab at the top
2. Click the **+ Add Color** button on the right side
3. A new row will appear with two fields:
   - **Name** — The name of the color (e.g., "Black", "Navy Blue", "White")
   - **Color** — The actual color shown to customers (a colored dot)
4. Type the color name in the Name field
5. Click the color dot to pick the exact shade you want (a color picker will appear)
6. Click **Save Changes** in the top-right corner

### How to Pick a Color

When you click on the color field, a **color picker** appears. You can:

- **Click and drag** on the color area to find the shade you want
- **Type a color code** if you know the exact shade (your designer or product team can give you this)
- The preview will update in real time so you can see exactly what the customer will see

> **Tip:** Try to match the filter colors as closely as possible to your actual product colors. If your "Navy" products are a dark blue, make sure the filter dot is the same dark blue — not a light blue or royal blue.

### Editing a Color Filter

1. Find the color filter in the list
2. Click on the name or color to make changes
3. Update the name, color, or both
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Removing a Color Filter

1. Find the color filter you want to remove
2. Click the action button in the **Actions** column
3. The filter is removed
4. Click **Save Changes** to confirm

## Understanding the Filter Table

Each filter (whether category or color) is displayed in a simple table with these columns:

| Column | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The name of the filter (e.g., "Casual", "Black") |
| **Color** | (Colors tab only) A preview of the color dot that customers will see |
| **Actions** | Buttons to edit or delete the filter |

---

## Saving Your Changes

After making any changes to your filters:

1. Click the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner
2. Wait a moment for the changes to save
3. Visit your shop page to see the filters in action

> **Important:** Always click **Save Changes** after adding, editing, or removing filters. If you leave the page without saving, your changes will be lost.

---

## How Filters Appear to Customers

On your shop page, customers will see a filter area where they can:

- **Check or uncheck** category filters to show only products in specific categories
- **Click on color dots** to show only products in a specific color
- **Combine filters** — for example, show only "Formal" products that are "Black"
- **Clear filters** to go back to seeing all products

The more filters you set up, the easier it is for customers to find exactly what they want.

## Tips for Setting Up Filters

> **Tip:** Only add filters for categories and colors that you actually have products for. Having a "Red" color filter with zero red products is confusing for customers.

> **Tip:** Keep your filter names simple and familiar. Use common words like "Formal", "Casual", "Black", "White" — not internal codes or abbreviations.

> **Tip:** Do not add too many filters. 5-8 category filters and 5-10 color filters is usually plenty. Too many options can overwhelm customers instead of helping them.

> **Tip:** Review your filters whenever you add new product categories or colors. If you just started selling red coats, add a "Red" color filter so customers can find them.

> **Tip:** Think about what your customers search for most. If most customers ask for "formal" vs "casual" styles, those should definitely be in your category filters.

## Common Questions

### What is the difference between product categories and filter categories?

**Product categories** (in Products → Category) are used to organize your products internally and assign each product to a type.

**Filter categories** (in Settings → Filters) are what customers see and use on the shop page to narrow down products. They can be the same names as your product categories, but they do not have to be.

For example, you might have a product category called "Long Sleeve Shirts" but your filter might simply say "Shirts" to keep it simple for customers.

### I added a color filter but products are not filtering correctly. Why?

The color filters work based on the color variants you set up for your products. Make sure your products have color variants that match the filter colors you created. If a product does not have a color variant, it will not appear when customers filter by color.

### Can customers use multiple filters at the same time?

Yes! Customers can select multiple category filters and color filters at the same time. For example, they can filter for "Formal" + "Black" to see only formal black products.
